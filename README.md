# Module 11 - Web Scraping and Data Analysis by Anqa Javed

This project involves web scraping and analyzing Mars weather data. The project is broken down into two parts: scraping news articles from the Mars News website and scraping & analyzing Mars weather data. The data has been processed, visualized, and stored in a CSV file for future use.

## Steps Taken:
1. **Scraped Mars News Titles and Previews**:
    - Scraped titles and preview texts of articles from the Mars News website.
    - The data was stored in a list of dictionaries, each containing a title and preview.

2. **Scraped and Analyzed Mars Weather Data**:
    - Scraped Mars weather data from a provided website, including minimum temperatures and atmospheric pressures.
    - The data was cleaned, converted to appropriate data types, and analyzed to answer various questions:
        - How many Martian months exist?
        - How many Martian days worth of data are there?
        - Which months have the lowest and highest temperatures?
        - Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressures?
    - Visualized the data through bar charts to help answer the above questions.

3. **Exported Data**:
    - The analyzed data was saved into a CSV file for future reference and analysis.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** (Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Splinter, BeautifulSoup)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)

## Files:
- **`mars_weather_data.csv`** – Scraped weather data (temperature and pressure).
- **`part_1_mars_news.ipynb`** – Jupyter notebook for scraping Mars news articles.
- **`part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`** – Jupyter notebook for scraping and analyzing Mars weather data.

## Instructions to Run:
1. Install required libraries:  
    - `pip install pandas matplotlib splinter beautifulsoup4`
   
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks to perform web scraping and analysis.
